        | Nebraska is an extremely financially healthy state. With unemployment sitting at 2.7%, versus the 4.1% national average, and jobs paying well, if you have bad credit, you’re more likely to have the job and the money to pay back the higher interest rate in Nebraska than most places in the country. With good jobs and resources for debtors, it’s no surprise the Cornhusker State has the fifth lowest delinquency rate in the country - which sets a good precedent for debtors with low credit.

It also is home to the cheapest houses in the country and lowest house price growth in the nation. These trends have led it to least mortgage debt in the country.

        | By a fairly large margin, Wyoming has the lowest in-state tuition in the country. Educational loans are a common strain for those with poor credit and low tuition rates are helpful in that capacity. Additionally, specific licensure is required to collect debt in Wyoming, which has led to a low density of debt collectors in the state. However, average income levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, have nearly stagnated over the last five years.
